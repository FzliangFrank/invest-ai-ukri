## Welcome! 

**About** 

This project is dedicated for UK Research & Innovation in application of the role 
"Senior Analyst".

I come across UKRI data during my master degree. My "business project" use
Gateway to Research to try extract insight about research funding about 
"Artificial Intelligence" for University of Exeter. This *sample work* is my
rework at this project.


**Main Methodology**

This works use "Topic Modeling" (LDA) to extract interesting "funding abstract" related 
to "Artifical Intelligence".


**Programming Language**

The API call using `Python` (this is the only code section use that). All other 
analysis use `R`. 

The web page is a static html written in `quarto`.
